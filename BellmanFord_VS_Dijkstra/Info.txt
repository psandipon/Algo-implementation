Like Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman–Ford is based on the principle of relaxation, in which an approximation to the correct distance is gradually replaced by more accurate values until eventually reaching the optimum solution.


However, Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to greedily select the closest vertex that has not yet been processed, and performs this relaxation process on all of its outgoing edges; by contrast, the Bellman–Ford algorithm simply relaxes all the edges, and does this {\displaystyle |V|-1} |V|-1 times,


Bellman-Ford algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm, which allows for negative edge weight and can detect negative cycles in a graph.

Dijkstra algorithm is also another single-source shortest path algorithm. However, the weight of all the edges must be non-negative.
